   - Enhanced error boundary
   - Improved scroll restoration
   - Added global 404 route

2. **Sidebar.tsx**
   - Fixed navigation paths to match nested structure
   - Proper route alignment

3. **Training.jsx**
   - Removed broken dependencies
   - Fixed navigation paths
   - Added proper mock data

4. **AgentManagement.jsx**
   - Already properly configured for nested routing
   - Handles create/edit/view routes correctly

### 🎨 Loading & Error States:

1. **Enhanced Loading Fallback**
   - Better skeleton UI with backdrop blur
   - Improved visual consistency
   - Loading indicator with spinner

2. **Error Boundary**
   - Better error display with icons
   - Development mode error details
   - Multiple recovery options
   - Consistent styling

3. **Authentication Loading**
   - Proper loading states during auth checks
   - Smooth transitions between states

### 🛡️ Route Protection:

1. **ProtectedRoute Component**
